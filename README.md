Desktop Bitcoin Price Viewer
============================

A simple desktop app to show the Bitcoin price from Bitstamp in real-time. This is my first app built with Electron, so it is very simple.

Installation
------------

Install Electron globally.
```
npm i -g electron-prebuilt
```

Clone this repo then
```
cd desktop-bitcoin-price
electron .
```
